A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

## API Keys

Previous API keys are revoked. To enable maps:

- Android: set `com.google.android.geo.API_KEY` in `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
- iOS: set key in `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

Restrict keys (package/bundle IDs) and do not commit them. Xcode Simulator may work without keys; real devices/builds require valid keys.
