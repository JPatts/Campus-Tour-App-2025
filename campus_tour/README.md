## API Keys

API key access used by previous builds has been revoked. To enable maps and related services, create your own Google Maps API key and configure it here:

- Android: `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` (`com.google.android.geo.API_KEY`)
- iOS: `ios/Runner/Info.plist`

Restrict keys to your package/bundle IDs and do not commit keys to source control.
